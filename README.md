# Diabetes Disease Predictor

The Diabetes Prediction app is a machine learning-based tool designed to assist in predicting the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on key health measurements. By analyzing factors like age, BMI, insulin levels, and blood pressure, the app predicts whether a patient is likely to have diabetes or not. It features a simple user interface where users input medical data, and the app displays the predicted diagnosis along with the probability of the patient having diabetes.

This app was developed as part of a machine learning exercise using the publicly available Pima Indians Diabetes Database. Please note that this dataset may not be fully reliable for clinical use, as the project was created for educational purposes in machine learning and is not intended for professional medical applications.
